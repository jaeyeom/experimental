* DONE Reordering Todo Items Feature

** Overview

This feature will allow users to reorder todo items by moving them up or down
within their sibling group. This applies to both root-level items and subtasks.

** DONE Core Package Changes [3/3]

*** DONE Add New Methods to core.List [2/2]
**** DONE MoveUp(id string) error
- Find the item with the given ID
- If it's the first sibling, return an error
- Swap positions with the previous sibling
- Return nil on success

**** DONE MoveDown(id string) error
- Find the item with the given ID
- If it's the last sibling, return an error
- Swap positions with the next sibling
- Return nil on success

*** DONE Error Types
#+begin_src go
var (
    ErrItemNotFound = errors.New("item not found")
    ErrNoSibling = errors.New("no sibling in that direction")
)
#+end_src

*** DONE Test Cases for core.List [2/2]
**** DONE TestMoveUp
- [X] Moving first root item up returns error
- [X] Moving first subtask up returns error
- [X] Moving middle item up succeeds
- [X] Moving last item up succeeds
- [X] Moving non-existent item returns error

**** DONE TestMoveDown
- [X] Moving last root item down returns error
- [X] Moving last subtask down returns error
- [X] Moving middle item down succeeds
- [X] Moving first item down succeeds
- [X] Moving non-existent item returns error

** DONE Storage Package Changes [2/2]

*** DONE SQLite Storage [2/2]
**** DONE Update Save Method
- [X] Verify sibling_order handling works with reordering
- [X] Add test cases for order preservation after moves

**** DONE Update Load Method
- [X] Verify items load in correct order after moves
- [X] Add test cases for order preservation

*** DONE JSON Storage [2/2]
**** DONE Update Save Method
- [X] Verified that no changes needed - order is preserved in JSON format
- [X] Verified by existing tests

**** DONE Update Load Method
- [X] Verified that no changes needed - order is preserved from JSON
- [X] Verified by existing tests

** DONE CLI Changes

*** DONE Add New Commands
**** DONE moveup <id>
Move the specified item up among its siblings
#+begin_example
todo moveup <id>     Move a todo item up
#+end_example

**** DONE movedown <id>
Move the specified item down among its siblings
#+begin_example
todo movedown <id>   Move a todo item down
#+end_example

*** DONE Error Messages
- [X] Implement "Cannot move first item up"
- [X] Implement "Cannot move last item down"
- [X] Implement "Item not found"

** DONE Implementation Steps

*** DONE Phase 1: Core Implementation [3/3]
1. [X] Write test cases for MoveUp and MoveDown
2. [X] Implement MoveUp and MoveDown in core.List
3. [X] Run tests and verify behavior

*** DONE Phase 2: Storage Layer [3/3]
1. [X] Verify existing storage implementations handle reordering
2. [X] Add test cases for order preservation
3. [X] Verified no changes needed in storage implementations

*** DONE Phase 3: CLI Integration
1. [X] Add up/down commands to CLI
2. [X] Write integration tests
3. [X] Update help documentation

** DONE Test Plan

*** DONE Unit Tests [4/4]
1. [X] Test reordering root items
2. [X] Test reordering subtasks
3. [X] Test error cases
4. [X] Test order preservation across save/load

*** DONE Integration Tests
1. [X] Test CLI commands
2. [X] Test persistence of order changes
3. [X] Test with both storage backends
