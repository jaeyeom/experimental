#+TITLE: Spacemacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Jaehyun Yeom
#+DATE: 2025-01-28
#+TODO: TODO DOING | DONE

* Overview

This directory contains the Spacemacs configuration used in this project.

* Setup

** Automated Setup (Recommended)

Use the ~./ensure.sh~ script under ~devtools/setup-dev/ansible/~ directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd devtools/setup-dev/ansible
./ensure.sh spacemacs
#+END_SRC

This will set up Spacemacs with all necessary configurations and dependencies.

** Available Playbooks

- ~spacemacs.yml~ - Main Spacemacs setup
- ~spacemacs-go.yml~ - Go development configuration for Spacemacs
- ~emacs.yml~ - Base Emacs setup
- ~emacs-lsp-booster.yml~ - LSP performance enhancements

* Configuration Files

** .spacemacs

The main Spacemacs configuration file. This contains:
- Layer configurations
- Package settings
- Custom functions and keybindings
- User preferences

This file is deployed to ~~/.spacemacs~ by the Ansible setup scripts.

* Usage

After running the setup script, launch Spacemacs with:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
emacs
#+END_SRC

On first launch, Spacemacs will install all configured packages automatically.

* Future Works
** TODO Fix warnings
The compilation warnings can be check by the following command:
#+begin_src sh
  touch .spacemacs
  make
#+end_src
** DOING Use EDNC (Emacs Desktop Notification Center)

EDNC (ednc.el) is an Emacs package that implements a desktop notification service
entirely in Emacs Lisp, serving as a flexible replacement for external notification
daemons like Dunst.

*** Features:
- *Log Buffer (~*ednc-log*~)*: Provides a persistent, interactive history of all
  notifications that you can view, expand, dismiss, and interact with
- *Desktop Notification Server*: Implements the freedesktop.org D-Bus notification
  spec, replacing external notification daemons
- *Interactive Controls*:
  - TAB to expand/collapse notifications
  - RET or Mouse-1 to invoke default actions
  - 'd' or Mouse-3 to dismiss notifications
  - Mouse-2 to prioritize notifications
- *Pure Emacs Lisp*: No external dependencies beyond D-Bus support
- *Highly Customizable*: Via hooks like ~ednc-notification-amendment-functions~
  and ~ednc-notification-presentation-functions~

*** Usage:
#+begin_src elisp
;; Enable EDNC mode
(ednc-mode 1)

;; View notifications
M-x ednc-log  ; or switch to *ednc-log* buffer
#+end_src

*** Claude Code Integration:
EDNC can be used as a notification handler for Claude Code hooks defined in
~spacemacs/.spacemacs~. This allows you to receive Emacs notifications when
Claude Code events occur (e.g., tool completions, errors, or task updates),
keeping you informed within your Emacs workflow without relying on external
notification systems.
