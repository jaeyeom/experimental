# Configuration for mdlinkfix tool
# This file is used to resolve markdown links in Claude documentation.
#
# Links like [Slash commands](/en/slash-commands) will be resolved to:
# - Local file: slash-commands.md (if it exists in this directory)
# - URL: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands (if no local file)
#
# This file is compatible with direnv (https://direnv.net/)

# Base URL for external links (when no local file exists)
export MDLINK_BASE_URL=https://code.claude.com/docs

# Prefix in links that maps to this local directory
# e.g., /en/slash-commands -> slash-commands.md
export MDLINK_LOCAL_PREFIX=/en

# Suffix to add when checking for local files
export MDLINK_SUFFIX_ADD=.md
