* Product Requirements Document (PRD)

** Overview

DevCheck is a command-line tool designed to automatically detect the current
repository context and run all appropriate formatters, linters, and quality
checks. The primary goal is to minimize the need for extensive rule
documentation in =CLAUDE.md= or =AGENTS.md= by providing actionable output that
AI coding agents can directly consume and act upon.

** Problem Statement

Currently, AI coding agents require extensive rule documentation to understand
how to properly format, lint, and test code in different project contexts. This
leads to:
- Maintenance overhead of keeping rules up-to-date
- Inconsistent application of formatting and linting across different parts of the codebase
- Manual intervention required to run appropriate tools for different file types
- Cognitive load on developers to remember which tools to run in which contexts

** Solution

A unified command-line tool that:
1. Prioritizes universal build systems (Bazel, Make) over language-specific tools
2. Automatically detects and runs appropriate formatters, linters, and quality checks
3. Provides human-readable output that doubles as clear prompts for LLM consumption
4. Eliminates the need for extensive rule documentation

** Target Users

- AI coding agents (primary)
- Developers working on the codebase (secondary)
- CI/CD pipelines (future consideration)

** Core Requirements

*** Functional Requirements

**** FR-1: Repository Detection
- Detect presence of Go modules (=go.mod=)
- Detect Python projects (=pyproject.toml=, =requirements.txt=)
- Detect TypeScript/JavaScript projects (=package.json=, =tsconfig.json=)
- Detect Bazel projects (=BUILD.bazel=, =MODULE.bazel=)
- Detect Makefile-based projects

**** FR-2: Automatic Tool Execution (Priority Order)
1. *Bazel projects*: Run =bazel run //tools:format=, =bazel run //tools:lint=, =bazel test //...=
2. *Make projects*: Run =make format=, =make lint=, =make test=
3. *Fallback to language-specific tools*:
   - Run =gofumpt= and =golangci-lint= for Go projects
   - Run =ruff format= and =ruff check= for Python projects
   - Run =npm run lint= and =npm run format= for TypeScript projects

**** FR-3: LLM-Friendly Output
- Provide human-readable output that serves as clear prompts for AI agents
- Include specific error messages and file locations in natural language
- Include actionable suggestions for fixes
- Summarize results in a format that guides next steps
- Optional structured output for programmatic consumption (low priority)

**** FR-4: Smart Execution
- Only run tools relevant to changed files (when possible)
- Skip tools that are not applicable to current context
- Handle missing tools gracefully with informative messages
- Respect existing configuration files (=.golangci.yml=, =pyproject.toml=, etc.)

*** Non-Functional Requirements

**** NFR-1: Performance
- Complete execution within 30 seconds for typical repository sizes
- Provide progress indicators for long-running operations
- Support parallel execution of independent tools

**** NFR-2: Reliability
- Handle missing dependencies gracefully
- Provide clear error messages for configuration issues
- Exit with appropriate status codes for CI/CD integration

**** NFR-3: Usability
- Zero-configuration operation for standard project layouts
- Support dry-run mode for preview without making changes
- Provide verbose mode for debugging

** Detailed Design

*** Command Line Interface

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
devcheck [OPTIONS] [PATH]

OPTIONS:
  --dry-run, -n        Show what would be done without executing
  --verbose, -v        Verbose output for debugging
  --format=TYPE        Output format (prompt, summary, json)
  --filter=TYPE        Run only specific tool types (format, lint, test)
  --changed-only       Run only on changed files (requires git)
  --force-fallback     Skip Bazel/Make and use language-specific tools

EXAMPLES:
  devcheck                    # Run all applicable tools in current directory
  devcheck --dry-run          # Preview what would be executed
  devcheck --filter=format    # Run only formatters
  devcheck --changed-only     # Process only git-changed files
#+END_SRC

*** Output Format

**** LLM Prompt Format (Default)
#+BEGIN_SRC text
🔧 DevCheck Report

Repository Analysis:
- Build System: Makefile detected (universal formatting/linting available)
- Languages: Go, Python, TypeScript detected
- Strategy: Using make-based tools for consistency

Tools Executed:
✅ make format - Successfully formatted 15 files
❌ make lint - Found 1 issue requiring attention
⏳ make test - Skipped (use --filter=test to include)

Issues Found:
📍 main.go:42:10 - gosec error: Potential file inclusion via variable
   Suggestion: Use filepath.Join or validate input before file operations
   Fix: Replace direct file path concatenation with proper validation

Next Steps for AI Agent:
1. Fix the gosec issue in main.go:42 by adding input validation
2. Run 'make test' after fixing to ensure no regressions
3. Commit changes with message: "fix: add input validation for file operations"

Status: 🚨 Requires attention (1 linting issue)
#+END_SRC

**** JSON Output (Optional, --format=json)
Available for programmatic consumption but deprioritized.

*** Tool Detection Logic

**** Detection Priority Order
#+BEGIN_SRC text
1. BUILD.bazel or MODULE.bazel found → Use Bazel (bazel run //tools:format, //tools:lint)
2. Makefile found → Use Make (make format, make lint, make test)
3. Language-specific fallback:
   - go.mod found → Go tools (gofumpt, golangci-lint)
   - pyproject.toml found → Python tools (ruff)
   - package.json found → Node.js tools (npm run lint/format)
#+END_SRC

**** Smart Filtering
- Check if tools are actually installed before attempting to run
- Parse configuration files to understand available npm scripts
- Respect .gitignore and similar ignore files
- Support project-specific configuration via =.ai-dev-assistant.yaml=

- Positive developer feedback on tool usability

** Technical Considerations

*** Dependencies
- Go 1.21+ for implementation
- External tools: =gofumpt=, =golangci-lint=, =ruff=, =npm=
- Optional: =git= for changed-file detection

*** Configuration
- Support for =.ai-dev-assistant.yaml= configuration file
- Environment variable overrides
- Respect existing tool configurations

*** Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when tools are missing
- Clear error messages with installation instructions
- Proper exit codes for automation

** Risk Mitigation

*** Technical Risks
- *Tool compatibility*: Test with multiple versions of external tools
- *Performance*: Implement timeout mechanisms and parallel execution
- *Configuration conflicts*: Respect existing tool configurations

*** Adoption Risks
- *Learning curve*: Provide clear examples and documentation
- *Integration complexity*: Start with simple use cases and expand

** Future Enhancements

*** Planned Features
- Support for additional languages (Rust, Java, C++)

- Slack/Discord notifications for team workflows

** Conclusion

DevCheck will significantly reduce the complexity of maintaining development
workflow rules while providing AI agents with the structured information they
need to effectively assist in code quality maintenance. By automating the
detection and execution of appropriate tools, we can focus on writing great code
rather than managing tooling complexity.
