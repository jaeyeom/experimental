** Prerequisites

*** Required
- *Go 1.21+* - For Go-based tools (most tools in this directory)

- *Emacs* - For org-lint and other Emacs-related tools
- *GitHub CLI (gh)* - For gh-nudge utilities
- *Ansible* - For setup-dev automation
- *rsync* - For repo-sync file synchronization

** Common Installation Pattern

Most Go-based tools follow this pattern:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Install from GitHub (recommended)
go install github.com/jaeyeom/experimental/devtools/<tool-name>/cmd/<tool-name>@latest

# Or install from source
cd devtools/<tool-name>
go install ./cmd/<tool-name>

# Or build with Bazel
bazel build //devtools/<tool-name>/...
#+END_SRC

** Adding New Tools

1. Create tool directory under =devtools/=
2. Follow project structure conventions:
   #+BEGIN_SRC text
   devtools/<tool-name>/
   ├── cmd/<tool-name>/     # Main entry point
   │   └── main.go
   ├── internal/            # Internal packages
   ├── BUILD.bazel          # Bazel configuration
   ├── go.mod               # Go module file (if applicable)
   └── README.org           # Tool documentation
   #+END_SRC

3. Write comprehensive README with:
   - Clear overview and problem statement
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Key features
   - Prerequisites

4. Add entry to this main README under appropriate category

** Documentation Standards

- Use Org-mode format (=.org= files) for consistency
- Include practical examples
- Document prerequisites and dependencies
- Provide both basic and advanced usage
- Link to related issues or PRs

** Testing Requirements

- Include unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for tools with external dependencies
- Test across supported platforms when applicable
- Follow Test Driven Development practices

** Code Quality

From repository root, run quality checks:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Format, test, and lint (uses Makefile in repo root)
make

# Or explicitly
make format test lint
#+END_SRC

** Building with Go

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Build binary
go build ./cmd/<tool-name>

# Build and install to GOPATH/bin from local code (convenient during development)
go install ./cmd/<tool-name>

# Install from local changes using relative path from repo root
go install ./devtools/<tool-name>/cmd/<tool-name>

# Install from GitHub (latest release)
go install github.com/jaeyeom/experimental/devtools/<tool-name>/cmd/<tool-name>@latest
#+END_SRC

** Building with Bazel

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Build specific tool
bazel build //devtools/<tool-name>/...

# Build all devtools
bazel build //devtools/...

# Run tests
bazel test //devtools/<tool-name>/...
#+END_SRC

** Integration with Pre-commit Hooks

Many tools can be integrated into Git pre-commit hooks:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Run affected tests
bazel-affected-tests | xargs bazel test

# Run quality checks
devcheck

# Lint org files
git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep '\.org$' | xargs org-lint
#+END_SRC

** CI/CD Integration

Example GitHub Actions workflow:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
- name: Install devtools
  run: |
    go install github.com/jaeyeom/experimental/devtools/devcheck/cmd/devcheck@latest
    go install github.com/jaeyeom/experimental/devtools/bazel-affected-tests/cmd/bazel-affected-tests@latest

- name: Run quality checks
  run: devcheck

- name: Run affected tests
  run: bazel-affected-tests | xargs bazel test
#+END_SRC
