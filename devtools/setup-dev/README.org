#+TITLE: setup-dev
This directory will contain scripts to set up my development environment.

* Motivation
Whenever I get a new machine, I spend some time setting up my development
environment. To avoid repetition, I started writing a shell script. From there,
I'm exploring other solutions like GNU Make to make this script more idempotent
and effective for provisioning.
