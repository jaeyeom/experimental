#+TITLE: setup-dev

Ansible playbooks for setting up development environments across macOS, Linux, and Termux.

See [[file:ansible/README.org][ansible/README.org]] for documentation.

* Bootstrap (Fresh Machine)

On a fresh machine, run the bootstrap script to clone the repository and set up
prerequisites:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaeyeom/experimental/main/devtools/setup-dev/ansible/bootstrap.sh | sh
#+END_SRC

The bootstrap script will:
1. Install git if not present
2. Clone the repository to =~/go/src/github.com/jaeyeom/experimental=
3. Guide you through running =ensure.sh=

Note: The repository location is fixed because some ansible playbooks (e.g.,
=setup-spacemacs.yml=) create symlinks that expect this path.

* Quick Start (Existing Clone)

If you already have the repository cloned:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd ansible
./ensure.sh all
#+END_SRC
