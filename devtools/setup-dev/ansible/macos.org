#+TITLE: MacOS Support Plan for Ansible Setup Dev

* Overview

This document outlines the plan for adding MacOS support to the Ansible setup-dev project.

* Ansible Homebrew Support

Ansible does support MacOS Homebrew through the =community.general.homebrew= module. This module allows us to:

- Install packages via Homebrew
- Add and use Homebrew taps
- Update Homebrew itself
- Upgrade all packages
- Install packages with specific options

The module is part of the community.general collection and can be installed with:

#+begin_src sh
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
#+end_src

* Implementation Plan

** Step 1: Modify generate_packages.go

The =generate_packages.go= file needs to be modified to:

1. Add a =brewPkgName= field to the =PackageData= struct
2. Add a =BrewPkgName()= method similar to =DebianPkgName()= and =TermuxPkgName()=
3. Modify the =packagesTemplate= to include MacOS Homebrew support
4. Ensure Debian packages are not installed on MacOS

** Step 2: Update Template Conditions

The template in =generate_packages.go= needs to be updated to:

1. Check for MacOS using =ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Darwin"=
2. Use the =community.general.homebrew= module for MacOS
3. Exclude MacOS from the Debian/Ubuntu package installation section

** Step 3: Shell Profile Support

For MacOS, we need to:

1. Detect if the shell is zsh (default on MacOS)
2. Use =~/.zshrc= instead of =~/.bashrc= for profile settings
3. Create a helper function to determine the appropriate profile file

** Step 4: Update ensure.sh Script

The =ensure.sh= script needs to be updated to:

1. Detect MacOS
2. Install Homebrew if not already installed
3. Install Ansible via pip or Homebrew on MacOS
4. Set appropriate environment variables for MacOS

** Step 5: Test and Validate

1. Test the changes on a MacOS system
2. Verify that the correct package manager is used
3. Ensure that shell profile settings are correctly applied

* Implementation Details

** Modified PackageData Struct

#+begin_src go
type PackageData struct {
    command       string
    debianPkgName string
    UbuntuPPA     string
    termuxPkgName string
    brewPkgName   string    // Field for Homebrew package name
    brewTap       string    // Field for Homebrew tap
    brewOptions   []string  // Field for Homebrew install options
    Imports       []string
    Suffix        string
}

func (p PackageData) BrewPkgName() string {
    if p.brewPkgName != "" {
        return p.brewPkgName
    }
    return p.command
}

func (p PackageData) BrewTap() string {
    return p.brewTap
}

func (p PackageData) BrewOptions() []string {
    return p.brewOptions
}
#+end_src

** Modified Template

The template needs to include a new section for MacOS with support for taps and
options and the Debian section needs to be updated.

** Shell Profile Helper

Create a new playbook for shell profile detection:

#+begin_src yaml
- name: Detect user shell and set profile path
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Get user shell
      shell: echo $SHELL
      register: user_shell
      changed_when: false

    - name: Set profile path for bash
      set_fact:
        user_profile_path: "~/.bashrc"
      when: user_shell.stdout is search('/bash$')

    - name: Set profile path for zsh
      set_fact:
        user_profile_path: "~/.zshrc"
      when: user_shell.stdout is search('/zsh$')

{{ if .BrewTap }}
    - name: Tap {{.BrewTap}} for {{.Command}}
      community.general.homebrew_tap:
        name: {{.BrewTap}}
        state: present
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Darwin"
{{ end }}
    - name: Ensure {{.Command}} is present on MacOS
      community.general.homebrew:
        name: {{.BrewPkgName}}
        state: present{{ if .BrewOptions }}
        install_options:{{ range .BrewOptions }}
          - {{ . }}{{ end }}{{ end }}
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Darwin"
#+end_src

* Next Steps

1. Implement the changes to =generate_packages.go= ✓
   - Added support for Homebrew taps and options ✓
2. Create a shell profile detection playbook
3. Update the =ensure.sh= script
4. Test the changes on a MacOS system
5. Document the MacOS support in the README.org file

* Examples

** Package with Tap and Options

#+begin_src go
// Example of a package that uses a tap and install options
{command: "emacs",
 brewPkgName: "emacs-plus",
 brewTap: "d12frosted/emacs-plus",
 brewOptions: []string{"--with-native-comp", "--with-modern-icon"}}
#+end_src

This will generate an Ansible task that installs emacs-plus from the d12frosted/emacs-plus tap with native compilation and modern icon options.
