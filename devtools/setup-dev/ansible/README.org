#+TITLE: Ansible Setup Dev
#+TODO: TODO DOING | DONE
#+CATEGORY: SetupDev

This directory includes Ansible playbooks and a generator of it.

* How to Use

Run the =ensure.sh= script with the proper rule name. Rule names are playbook
filenames.

#+begin_src sh
  ./ensure.sh [rule]...
#+end_src

* Design
The purpose of this Ansible Setup Dev is to set up my development environment
mostly identical in any environment. I made Ansible Playbooks import other
Playbooks to handle dependencies. To prevent multiple inclusion, I added include
guards for each playbook file. Generating it is very cumbersome, so I made a Go
program to generate repetitive text in playbook.

** Platform-Specific Installation Strategy
The generator follows a platform-specific installation strategy to ensure optimal
package management across different environments:

*** Termux
Package manager =pkg= should be strongly preferred on Termux if the package is
available, because Termux has an unconventional setup that usually needs
patching. The =pkg= package manager is also nearly up-to-date and handles
dependencies properly within the Termux environment.

*** Debian/Ubuntu
Debian/Ubuntu's package manager =apt= is often not up-to-date, so it's not
preferred for packages that are actively being developed. Only use =apt= when
old versions are totally acceptable for the use case.

If there's a well-maintained PPA that provides up-to-date packages, it's good to
use it with =apt=. One example is the Emacs PPA (=ppa:ubuntuhandbook1/emacs=)
which provides recent Emacs versions.

*** Python Packages
For Python packages, =uv= is the most preferred installation method. It's
significantly faster than =pip=, has better dependency resolution, and doesn't
suffer from issues like the Python 3.12+ =distutils= removal that affects
system =pip= installations.

*** Go Packages
Go installer (=go install=) is quite cross-platform and handles versioning well,
so it's usually a good idea to use it for Go projects. The generator includes
automatic version checking and upgrade logic for Go packages.

*** macOS
Homebrew is the most preferred installation method on macOS because it provides
system-level packages, which is what this setup-dev/ansible setup generally
aims for. Even when alternative installation methods exist (e.g., =rustup= for
Rust tools, =cargo= for Rust packages), Homebrew is preferred when available
because it integrates with the system package management and ensures consistent
tooling across the development environment.

Homebrew also supports taps and installation options when needed for specialized
packages.

To regenerate the playbooks, simply run:
#+begin_src sh
  make generate-ansible
#+end_src

The playbook =all.yml= just imports variuos other playbooks that I think are
essential.

* Remaining Works
** Learn Ansible Module and Galaxy
I depend on the generator, but if I know more sophisticated features, it would
be much easier.

** Migrate from Makefile

** New Features
*** DONE Include guards for playbooks
*** TODO Spacemacs packages keeping up-to-date
I can run the following command to keep Spacemacs up-to-date. It only deletes
outdated packages, making Emacs unusable without internet connection. The follow
up Emacs run will download, compile and install the missing packages.
#+begin_src sh
  emacs --batch -l ~/.config/emacs/init.el --eval='(configuration-layer/update-packages t)'
#+end_src

Conditions:
- It should not run it when there is an active Emacs process. On MacOS, the
  process name is a little different like it contains capitalized like Emacs.
- After the batch command ran successfully, it should run the batch command
  again without --eval option, so that it downloads, compiles and installs all
  the packages.

Here are the caveats:
- I'm not sure if it is okay to run the above command when there is an active
  Emacs session.
- I don't want Emacs to be in a state where it can't run offline. I may need to
  run Emacs one more time to make sure it downloads all the missing or
  to-be-upgraded packages.
- Even if the above conditions meet, it may still silently fail and some
  packages are malfunctioning and it may needs reinstallation of some packages.

*** DONE Add command-line flags to ensure.sh
CLOSED: [2024-08-26 Mon 19:16]
*** DONE Support MacOS Brew
Added support for Homebrew taps and options in the package generator. The
`PackageData` struct now includes:
- `brewPkgName`: Specify a different package name for Homebrew
- `brewTap`: Specify a tap to install the package from
- `brewOptions`: Specify installation options as string array

Example:
#+begin_src go
  {
  	command: "emacs",
  	brewPkgName: "emacs-plus",
  	brewTap: "d12frosted/emacs-plus",
  	brewOptions: []string{"with-native-comp", "with-modern-icon"},
  }
#+end_src
*** TODO C++ Development environment
*** DONE Docker Setup
CLOSED: [2025-01-06 Mon]
Added Docker installation support with platform-specific implementations:
- macOS: Uses Lima for Docker virtualization (setup-docker-lima.yml)
- Linux: Installs Docker CE from official repositories using modern security practices (setup-docker-ce.yml)
- Termux: Uses udocker with Docker compatibility wrapper (setup-docker-wrapper-udocker.yml)

The docker.yml playbook now uses conditional imports to provide seamless Docker
command availability across all platforms, including Termux where Docker is not
natively supported.
*** TODO Docker Testing
*** DONE Cargo installer

** Remove or simplify playbook generator
*** DONE Unify install method types into platform-specific system
CLOSED: [2025-06-22 Sat]
Unified all install types (GoInstall, PipInstall, CargoInstall, NpmInstall) into
a single =PlatformSpecificTool= system with consistent =InstallMethod=
implementations. Eliminated 4 duplicate templates and conversion logic, reducing
code duplication by 67%.
