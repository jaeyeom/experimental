#+TITLE: Ansible Setup Dev

This directory includes Ansible playbooks and a generator of it.

* How to Use

Run the =ensure.sh= script with the proper rule name. Rule names are playbook
filenames.

#+begin_src sh
  ./ensure.sh [rule]...
#+end_src

* Design
The purpose of this Ansible Setup Dev is to set up my development environment
mostly identical in any environment. I made Ansible Playbooks import other
Playbooks to handle dependencies. To prevent multiple inclusion, I added include
guards for each playbook file. Generating it is very cumbersome, so I made a Go
program to generate repetitive text in playbook.

To regenerate the playbooks, simply run:
#+begin_src sh
  go run .
#+end_src

The playbook =all.ynl= just imports variuos other playbooks that I think are
essential.

* Remaining Works
** Learn Ansible Module and Galaxy
I depend on the generator, but if I know more sophisticated features, it would
be much easier.

** New Features
*** DONE Include guards for playbooks
*** TODO Spacemacs packages keeping up-to-date
I can run the following command to keep Spacemacs up-to-date.
#+begin_src sh
  emacs --batch -l ~/.config/emacs/init.el --eval='(configuration-layer/update-packages t)'
#+end_src

Here are the caveats:
- I'm not sure if it is okay to run the above command when there is an active
  Emacs session.
- I don't want Emacs to be in a state where it can't run offline. I may need to
  run Emacs one more time to make sure it downloads all the missing or
  to-be-upgraded packages.

*** DONE Add command-line flags to ensure.sh

*** DONE Support MacOS Brew
Added support for Homebrew taps and options in the package generator. The `PackageData` struct now includes:
- `brewPkgName`: Specify a different package name for Homebrew
- `brewTap`: Specify a tap to install the package from
- `brewOptions`: Specify installation options as string array

Example:
#+begin_src go
  {
  	command: "emacs",
  	brewPkgName: "emacs-plus",
  	brewTap: "d12frosted/emacs-plus",
  	brewOptions: []string{"with-native-comp", "with-modern-icon"},
  }
#+end_src
*** TODO C++ Development environment
*** DONE Docker Setup

Added Docker installation support:
- macOS: Uses Lima for Docker virtualization with brew installation
- Linux: Installs Docker CE from official repositories
- Termux: Skipped (not supported)
*** TODO Docker Testing

Cargo generator should be similar to what =PipInstall= does in
=generate_packages.go= file.
