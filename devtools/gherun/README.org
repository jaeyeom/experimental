#+TITLE: gherun - Gherkin Test Runner with Perplexity Comet
#+OPTIONS: toc:2

* Overview

~gherun~ is a CLI tool that orchestrates Gherkin-based feature tests using
[[https://www.perplexity.ai/][Perplexity's Comet Browser]]. It bridges the gap between human-readable test
specifications and AI-powered browser automation.

* Motivation

Traditional end-to-end testing requires significant investment in test
infrastructure, browser drivers, and maintenance. As AI-powered browsers become
more capable, we can leverage them to execute tests described in natural
language.

** Why Gherkin?

Gherkin provides a structured yet human-readable format for describing software
behavior. Its Given-When-Then syntax maps naturally to test instructions that an
AI browser can understand and execute.

** Why Perplexity Comet?

Perplexity's Comet Browser can interpret natural language instructions and
interact with web applications autonomously. By combining Gherkin specifications
with Comet's capabilities, we can:

- Write tests in plain English that both humans and AI can understand
- Reduce the need for fragile CSS selectors and XPath expressions
- Leverage AI's ability to adapt to UI changes
- Get detailed failure reports with context

* Comparison with Playwright

[[https://playwright.dev/][Playwright]] is a powerful, widely-adopted browser automation framework. Here's
how gherun compares:

| Aspect                | Playwright                        | gherun + Comet                    |
|-----------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------|
| Test language         | JavaScript/TypeScript/Python      | Gherkin (natural language)        |
| Element selection     | CSS selectors, XPath, test IDs    | Natural language descriptions     |
| Setup complexity      | Moderate (install, config)        | Minimal (just write .feature)     |
| Execution speed       | Fast (milliseconds per action)    | Slower (AI processing overhead)   |
| Reliability           | Deterministic                     | Probabilistic (AI interpretation) |
| UI change resilience  | Brittle (selectors break)         | Adaptive (AI understands intent)  |
| Debugging             | Excellent (traces, screenshots)   | Limited (relies on AI reports)    |
| CI/CD integration     | Native support                    | Requires browser environment      |
| Cost                  | Free                              | Perplexity API/subscription       |
| Maintenance           | High (selector updates)           | Low (natural language is stable)  |

** When to Use Playwright

Choose Playwright when you need:

- *Fast, deterministic test execution* - CI/CD pipelines running hundreds of
  tests where speed and reliability are critical
- *Precise control* - Pixel-perfect assertions, network interception, or complex
  multi-tab scenarios
- *Headless execution* - Running tests in containers or CI environments without
  a display
- *Large test suites* - Thousands of tests that need to run in minutes
- *Offline testing* - No external API dependencies

** When to Use gherun

Choose gherun when you need:

- *Rapid prototyping* - Quickly validate user flows without writing code
- *Exploratory testing* - Let AI discover edge cases humans might miss
- *Non-technical stakeholders* - Business analysts or product managers can write
  and understand tests
- *Frequently changing UIs* - AI adapts to UI changes without selector updates
- *Complex user journeys* - Multi-step flows that are tedious to script but easy
  to describe
- *Manual test automation* - Convert existing manual test cases to automated
  tests with minimal effort
- *Accessibility testing* - AI can interact with the page like a real user,
  catching usability issues

** Hybrid Approach

Consider using both:

1. *Playwright for critical paths* - Login, checkout, payment flows that must be
   rock-solid and fast
2. *gherun for regression testing* - Broad coverage of features where AI
   adaptability reduces maintenance
3. *gherun for smoke tests* - Quick validation that major features work after
   deployments

#+begin_example
# CI Pipeline Example
stages:
  - playwright-critical    # Fast, deterministic critical path tests
  - deploy-staging
  - gherun-regression      # AI-powered broad regression testing
  - deploy-production
#+end_example

* Installation

** Using Bazel

#+begin_src sh
  bazel build //devtools/gherun/cmd/gherun
#+end_src

** Using Go

#+begin_src sh
  go install github.com/jaeyeom/experimental/devtools/gherun/cmd/gherun@latest
#+end_src

* Usage

** Basic Usage

#+begin_src sh
  gherun features/*.feature
#+end_src

This will:
1. Parse all ~.feature~ files
2. Create a GitHub issue with checkboxes for each feature
3. Open Perplexity Comet browser tabs with test prompts
4. Poll the GitHub issue until all tests are marked complete
5. Print a summary report

** Command Line Options

#+begin_example
gherun [flags] <feature-files...>

Flags:
  --parallel=3          Maximum concurrent browser tabs (default: 3)
  --poll-interval=90s   GitHub issue poll interval (default: 90s)
  --title="Test Suite"  GitHub issue title (default: "Gherkin Test Suite")
  --verbose             Enable verbose logging
#+end_example

** Examples

Run a single feature:
#+begin_src sh
  gherun features/login.feature
#+end_src

Run multiple features with custom parallelism:
#+begin_src sh
  gherun --parallel=5 --title="Release 2.0 Tests" features/*.feature
#+end_src

Run with verbose output:
#+begin_src sh
  gherun --verbose features/checkout.feature features/payment.feature
#+end_src

#+end_example

* GitHub Issue Format

The tool creates a GitHub issue with the following format:

#+begin_example
## Test Suite: My Tests

- **login** - User Login
    - [ ] PASSED
    - [ ] FAILED
- **checkout** - Shopping Checkout
    - [ ] PASSED
    - [ ] FAILED
#+end_example

Comet browser will check the appropriate checkbox after executing each test. If
a test fails, it will also leave a comment describing the failure.

* Prerequisites

- [[https://cli.github.com/][GitHub CLI]] (~gh~) installed and authenticated
- macOS (uses ~open~ command for launching browsers)
- Access to Perplexity Comet Browser

* Writing Feature Files

See [[file:GHERKIN_GUIDE.org][GHERKIN_GUIDE.org]] for detailed guidance on writing feature files that work
well with gherun and AI-powered browsers.

* Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning                    |
|------+----------------------------|
|    0 | All tests passed           |
|    1 | One or more tests failed   |
|    1 | Error during execution     |

* Limitations

- Currently only supports macOS (uses ~open~ command)
- Requires manual Perplexity Comet browser setup
- URL length limits may truncate very long feature files
- No retry mechanism for flaky tests

* Future Enhancements

- [ ] Custom prompt templates via ~--prompt-file~
- [ ] Support for Linux (~xdg-open~) and Windows (~start~)
- [ ] Webhook notifications on completion
- [ ] Test result history and trends
- [ ] Retry mechanism for failed tests
- [ ] Screenshot capture on failure
