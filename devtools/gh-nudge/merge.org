* Github Merge

** Overview

~gh-merge~ is a command-line utility that finds pull requests with no pending
review requests and are ready to merge (status: MERGEABLE). It can automatically
merge these PRs and optionally delete the source branch after merging.

** Features

- Find PRs that have no pending review requests
- Verify PRs are in a mergeable state
- Merge PRs automatically with optional branch deletion
- Support for dry-run mode to preview actions without executing them
- Reuse existing configuration from ~gh-nudge~

** Usage

#+begin_src shell
  # List mergeable PRs without taking action
  gh-merge list

  # Merge all eligible PRs
  gh-merge --auto

  # Merge and delete branches after merging
  gh-merge --auto -d

  # Dry run to preview what would be merged
  gh-merge --auto --dry-run

  # Use a custom config file
  gh-merge --config /path/to/config.yaml
#+end_src

** Configuration and Setup

Please see [[file:README.org][README.org]] file for the full configuration.

~gh-merge~ uses the same configuration file as ~gh-nudge~, typically located at
~$HOME/.config/gh-nudge/config.yaml~. The relevant sections for GitHub
integration are:

#+begin_src yaml
github:
  owner: "your-github-org"
  repos:
    - "repo1"
    - "repo2"
#+end_src

** Known Issues
*** Sometimes it needs to run 2 times
- Sometimes gh-merge merge should run 2 times to find the PRs to merge. I didn't
  dig into it, but that's probably because some reviewer team list is not
  processed (removed) until it is queried on the GitHub side.
