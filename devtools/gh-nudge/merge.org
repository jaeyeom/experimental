#+TITLE: gh-merge - Automated GitHub PR Merge Tool
#+AUTHOR: Jaehyun Yeom

* Github Merge

** Overview

~gh-merge~ is a command-line utility that finds pull requests with no pending
review requests and are ready to merge (status: MERGEABLE). It can automatically
merge these PRs and optionally delete the source branch after merging.

** Features

- Find PRs that have no pending review requests
- Verify PRs are in a mergeable state
- Merge PRs automatically with optional branch deletion
- Support for dry-run mode to preview actions without executing them
- Reuse existing configuration from ~gh-nudge~

** Usage

#+begin_src shell
  # List mergeable PRs without taking action
  gh-merge list

  # Merge all eligible PRs
  gh-merge --auto

  # Merge and delete branches after merging
  gh-merge --auto -d

  # Dry run to preview what would be merged
  gh-merge --auto --dry-run

  # Use a custom config file
  gh-merge --config /path/to/config.yaml
#+end_src

** Configuration and Setup

Please see [[file:README.org][README.org]] file for the full configuration.

~gh-merge~ uses the same configuration file as ~gh-nudge~, typically located at
~$HOME/.config/gh-nudge/config.yaml~. The relevant sections for GitHub
integration are:

#+begin_src yaml
github:
  owner: "your-github-org"
  repos:
    - "repo1"
    - "repo2"
#+end_src

** Implementation Plan

*** Command Structure

The tool will have the following command structure:

- ~gh-merge list~ - List PRs that are ready to merge
- ~gh-merge merge~ - Automatically merge eligible PRs

*** Core Components

1. PR finder - Find PRs with no review requests and mergeable status
2. Merge executor - Handle the merging of PRs and branch deletion
3. Configuration loader - Reuse configuration from ~gh-nudge~

** Next Steps

1. Update the models package to include mergeable status in PR struct
2. Enhance the GitHub client to fetch mergeable PRs and perform merges
3. Create the command-line interface for ~gh-merge~
4. Write tests for the new functionality
5. Update documentation with examples and use cases
