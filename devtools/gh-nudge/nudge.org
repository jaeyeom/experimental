* GitHub Nudge

A tool that finds pending code reviews on GitHub and nudges reviewers via Slack.

** Overview

GitHub Nudge is a utility designed to improve code review workflow by
automatically identifying stalled pull requests and sending gentle reminders to
assigned reviewers through Slack. This helps maintain momentum in the
development process and reduces delays in merging important changes.

** Features
- Uses GitHub CLI (`gh`) to identify pending pull requests
- Filters PRs based on configurable criteria (age, labels, etc.)
- Sends customized notifications to reviewers via Slack DMs
- Maps GitHub usernames to Slack usernames for proper @mentions
- Routes notifications to appropriate Slack channels based on file patterns in
  PRs
- Configurable reminder schedules and message templates
- Tracks notification history to prevent excessive reminders
- Persists notification history between runs to respect reminder thresholds

** TODO Implementation [4/7]
- [X] Set up GitHub CLI integration
- [ ] Implement PR filtering logic
- [X] Create GitHub-to-Slack username mapping
- [X] Implement Slack DM integration
- [X] Implement notification threshold with persistence
- [ ] Add file pattern matching for channel routing
- [ ] Build notification scheduling system
- [ ] Add configuration options

** Installation

#+begin_src shell
  go install github.com/jaeyeom/experimental/devtools/gh-nudge@latest
#+end_src

** Configuration and Setup

Please see [[file:README.org][README.org]] file for the full configuration.

** Usage

#+begin_src shell
  # Run with default configuration
  gh-nudge

  # Specify a custom configuration file
  gh-nudge --config /path/to/config.yaml

  # Run in dry-run mode (no notifications sent)
  gh-nudge --dry-run

  # Show verbose output
  gh-nudge --verbose
#+end_src

** Notification Persistence

GitHub Nudge tracks when notifications are sent to avoid spamming reviewers with
repeated reminders for the same PR. The notification history is persisted to a
JSON file between runs:

- When using a custom config file: stored in the same directory as the config
  file as `notifications.json`
- When using the default config location: stored at
  `$HOME/.config/gh-nudge/notifications.json`

This ensures that even if you run GitHub Nudge multiple times (e.g., via a
scheduled cron job), reviewers will only be notified about the same PR once per
`reminder_threshold_hours` period.
