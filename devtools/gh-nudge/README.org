* Github Nudge and Other Utilities

This subdirectory contains a few utilities integrated with Github.

- [[file:nudge.org][gh-nudge]]
- [[file:slack.org][gh-slack]]
- [[file:merge.org][gh-merge]]
- [[file:codeowners.org][gh-codeowners]]

** Prerequisites

1. [[https://cli.github.com/][Github CLI]] installed and authenticated
2. Slack API token for sending notifications

*** Obtaining a Slack API Token

To get a Slack API token for GitHub Nudge:

1. *Create a Slack App*:
   - Go to the [[https://api.slack.com/apps][Slack API website]]
   - Click "Create New App"
   - Choose "From scratch"
   - Name your app (e.g., "GitHub Nudge") and select your workspace
   - Click "Create App"

2. *Add Bot Permissions*:
   - In the left sidebar, click on "OAuth & Permissions"
   - Scroll down to "Scopes" section
   - Under "Bot Token Scopes", add the following permissions:
     - ~chat:write~ (to send messages)
     - ~im:write~ (to send direct messages)
     - ~users:read~ (to look up user information)

3. *Install App to Workspace*:
   - Scroll up to the top of the "OAuth & Permissions" page
   - Click "Install to Workspace"
   - Review the permissions and click "Allow"

4. *Get Your Bot Token*:
   - After installation, you'll be redirected back to the "OAuth & Permissions"
     page
   - Copy the "Bot User OAuth Token" that starts with ~xoxb-~
   - This is the token you'll need to add to your configuration file under
     ~slack.token~

*Note*: Slack tokens are sensitive credentials. Consider using environment
variables or a secrets manager in production environments rather than hardcoding
the token in your configuration file.
