#+TITLE: Experimental Mono Repo
This repository contains everything. It started as an experimental repository
where I could put random pieces of code. Later, I wanted to have a monorepo for
my code, and I realized that this repository could be the best option if I
cleaned it up a bit.

* Build System
** GNU Make
Please refer to =Makefile= for build rules.

** Bazel
This repository is experimenting with Bazel and the goal is to make it fully
hermetic, working both on Linux and Termux.
