## Instructions for Jules (non-local Cloud-based async workflow)

- Run `make check` and resolve all issues.
- After running `make`, which may generate files, ensure you `git add` the generated files.
- Do not commit an empty diff. If the diff is empty, something is wrong or files have not been added.
- Before signaling completion, ensure you `git push` your changes to apply them to the PR.
- Be aware of the correct PR number and do not work on a random one.
